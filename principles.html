<h2> Basic principles of Web Accessibility (Written in my own, awesome text) </h2>
<p2> Web accessibility, to me, means both how easy it is for users to understand and navigate a site in question. These can fluctuate based on website quality, but generally speaking a site should have easy-to-follow navigation links placed in obvious but non-obstructive places, it should have complimentary colours and styles and have a consistent styling. This is linked to and aids in understanding content on a page as having readily avaliable information (such as text and/or videos) in easy-to-find places makes content easier to digest and possibly more fun to digest. </p2>

<h2> Meaning of HTML validation (Composed of my own original, funky words) </h2>
<p2>In basic terms, HTML validation is a way to check if code is compiling in a way that doesn't run in to errors and points out any errors/mistakes in code for the user to see and fix. This can be done with a pre-existing tool that will do something such as highlighting errors in code to give a visual indication of an error. </p2>

<h2> Suggestions I would make to improve this site (A visual representation in text form, a result of a compilation of thoughts in reflection) </h2>
<p2>I sort of ran out of time, so I will initially say I think next time doing a task, I should think to work my skills up progressively instead of trying to tackle a task beyond current skill level. <br>
More specifically, and not just leaning on "time limitation", something I would change is having the site map text be over the top of the logo. It was admittedly a poor job in photohop that I decided to use. Is it readable? Yeah. Is it fun to read? Not really. (Oh, and don't think you didn't see all that pixel-y mess in and around it too, you can't miss it) <br> <br>
Another thing I would change is having a more cohesive idea of WHAT it was I was making. I wanted to make it Evangelion themed, but also needed to fit in products as well. These two didn't really go hand-in-hand. In the end it's clearly two separate ideas kinda sat next to each other, rather than one idea. The solution here would be more initial planning. </p2>

<h2> Differences seen in this site across different browsers (Even in the face of a challenge such as "making something consistent" I can overcome, and ruin your experience no matter the browser!) </h2>
<p2>Let's all be honest, this site only looks good from half a kilometere away, squinting, while facing the other direction... but we're here to talk about it's inconsistencies.<br>
First up, the thing I noticed the most: the marquee text along the top of the screen. In something like Chrome or Opera GX? Fine, smooth text. However in FireFox? It looks like you're running Cyberpunk 2077 on a Samsung fridge. It's obviously jittery and is a complete eyesore ontop of the whole rest of the site, of which is also an eyesore. (Double eyesore, ouch!) <br>
Another inconsistency I saw upon running this sad excuse of a website on differing browsers is there's a horizontal rule on the loadout page, that on Chrome and Opera GX is white, but on Firefox is black. It's not really an issue at all, but how uncool would I sound to only bring a single inconsistency to the table... and ironically enough there wasn't one in the table I used.<br>
