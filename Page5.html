<h2 class="Page1heading"> <u> Welcome Eva pilot! </u> </h2>
<p1 class="Page1firstp"> Think you've got what it takes to pilot a giant robot? No? Well today's your lucky day, because that's exactly what you're doin'! <br>
Before Tokyo 3 is subject to further relentless barrage of Angel attacks, let me give you a quick rundown on what we've got here. Oh, and we're really strapped for time so I mean QUICK. <br>
I want you to have a look around the place and familiarise yourself with the surroundings, then I'll get you to go headfirst into the line of fire! <br>
Strap in! This simulation is incredibly realistic! </p1>
